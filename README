Implementation of Rateless Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (Rateless IBLTs), as
proposed in paper Practical Rateless Set Reconciliation by Lei Yang, Yossi
Gilad, and Mohammad Alizadeh.

Rateless IBLTs map any set to an infinite sequence of "coded symbols", each of
the same size as a set element. For any two sets, their coded symbol sequences
are sufficient for computing their symmetric difference, therefor enabling
synchronization. The number of coded symbols needed is linear to the size of
the symmetric difference, with the coefficient converging to 1.35 as the
difference goes to infinitely large.

A good starting point is example_test.go, a self-contained example of using
this package to synchronize two sets of integers.
